DSA: Analysis and Design

ABCU is looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students. This software will organize the difference courses available and any prerequisites required for those courses.
I looked at all the different types of data structures and decided which would be best for this application.  Data structures are important because they all have their pros and cons depending on how data needs to be organized, accessed, and updated and changed.
Any roadblocks that I had were resolved by looking at the text and going online to find solutions.
I don't think the work on this project expanded or change to my approach to developing programs.  I always take and issue and choose what is best to solve it.  Nothing has changed with that.
I have always written programs that are hopefully easy to maintain, read, and adapt since I do refer back to past code for any problem that I am having with any current coding.
